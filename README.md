secretsfly is an easy to use, simple, with low number of dependencies, and fast secrets management tool with a focus on self-hosting and security.
Don't let third party manage your secrets, keep them yourself and avoid the risk of data leaks.

## Environment variables

- `AVAILABLE_ENVIRONMENTS`: Default: prod. Comma separated list of environments available globally.
- `ADMIN_MASTER_KEY_EXPIRATION`: Default: 300 (in seconds). Master key timeout, after which the master key is deleted from the session.

## How it works

- Secrets are encrypted by a master key per project. When storing secrets in the main database, the master key is temporarily stored in the session and needs to be kept secret by the end user.
- The master key is stored in the session and is deleted after a certain amount of time (see `ADMIN_MASTER_KEY_EXPIRATION`).
- The master key is generated by the user and is never stored on the application database. Therefore in a scenario where the secrets database is stolen, the secrets are still safe and cannot be decrypted.
- Secrets follow a project hierarchy - secrets coming from inherited projects are also available to the child projects.
